## Tutorial 

1. Sign Up for a Typeform Account 

   Use your Typeform account to create custom online surveys. We'll be using the "Webhooks" feature under "Integrate" to connect with Watson's Tone Analyzer API and to get survey data responses in real time. 

2. Sign Up for a IBM Cloud Account 

   We'll be using IBM Cloud's Bluemix Actions to run our code and process our data using IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/shubhaswamy/typeform-watson-tone/blob/master/assets/code/function.py). 

   - Configuring webhooks: 

     Connect webhooks by creating an "Endpoint" URL in IBM Actions and adding it as a "Destination URL" in Typeform's Webhooks configurations. This enables Typeform to send IBM Actions data in real time as users submit responses
